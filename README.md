# Burst-Aware-Dynamic-Time-Quantum-Round-Robin-Simulator-BA-DTQ-RR-Simulator-

## ðŸ“– Overview  
A Java-based CPU Scheduling Simulator that implements the Burst-Aware Dynamic Time Quantum Round Robin (BA-DTQ RR) algorithm with a user-friendly Swing GUI, Gantt chart visualization, and comparison with standard Round Robin scheduling.

## ðŸš€ Features  
 **Interactive GUI** built with Java Swing  
 **Add and remove processes dynamically**  
 **Gantt Chart Visualization** for execution order  
 **Automatic calculation** of:
- Completion Time (CT)  
- Turnaround Time (TAT)  
- Waiting Time (WT)  
 **Dynamic Time Quantum** adjustment per scheduling round  
 **Comparison mode** between standard Round Robin and BA-DTQ RR  
 **Average metrics display** for performance analysis  
 **Intro screen** with project information and logos

## ðŸ§© Algorithm Concept  
### ðŸ”¹ Burst-Aware Dynamic Time Quantum Round Robin  
The **BA-DTQ RR** algorithm improves upon the traditional Round Robin approach by **dynamically adjusting the time quantum** in each scheduling round based on process burst times.


## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion  

The **BA-DTQ RR Simulator** showcases how a dynamic quantum mechanism can significantly improve CPU scheduling performance.  
With a simple GUI and detailed results, this project helps visualize the impact of adaptive scheduling strategies in real time.  
It effectively demonstrates how minor algorithmic enhancements in scheduling can lead to better CPU utilization, reduced waiting times, and improved system responsiveness.
